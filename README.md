## Credits

The project is of the authorship of Jonathan Maldonado.The GitHub repo can be found at: <https://github.com/jguemarez/NoteTakerApp> .

The .gitignore file was lifted from the GitLab class repo found at: <https://git.bootcampcontent.com>.

The folder structure of the project and the helper functions and custom middleware has been adapted from those found in the activities and Mini-Project for the Module 11 of the Rutgers Full Stack Bootcamp.

This app works in the Node.js JavaScript runtime environment. The latest stable (recommended version) can be found at: <https://nodejs.org/en/download>

We import and make use of the built-in modules "path", "fs" and "util" from the standard library.

We use npm for the specification (semantic versioning) of the app's dependencies and their installation. Here is the URL for the official site of the npm registry: <https://www.npmjs.com>

In particular, we added  "express": "^4.16.4"(in order to create and work with servers, middleware, routers, etc.), "mysql2": "^., and "inquirer": "^8.2.4". You can find the most recent versions of the node packages here:

<https://www.npmjs.com/package/express> for Express; <https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2> for MySQL2; and <https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer> for Inquirer.


## How to Contribute

If you want to contribute, feel free to fork the repo, modify the repo on your local machine and then open a pull request. That way I can review the changes before deciding whther to merge them in the codebase or not.

## Tests

The app was manually tested multiple times before deployment by its author, checking for errors both in the browser's (Google Chrome DevTools for the front end) console and in the terminal (Git Bash for the back end). Before connecting the back-end to the front-end, some endpoints were tested using Insomnia 2023.5.17 as a client.

However, the user should keep an eye for any error thrown in the console and, if possible, open an issue in the GitHub repo detailing the bug. In the future, it would be interesting to devise some tests using a node package like JEST (documentation available at: <https://jestjs.io/docs>.)
